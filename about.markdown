I am an **Ethical Hacker and Malware Researcher**, primarily self-taught, with a strong focus on **malware development, offensive security tool development, malware analysis**. My passion for cybersecurity began almost two years ago and since then, I have been on a continuous journey of learning and improving my skills in both offensive and defensive security.
